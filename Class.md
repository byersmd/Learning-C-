**Classes**

```C#
using System;

class VerySimple //classes are treated similar to objects, they provide definition and functionality
{
   //fields (data)
   int simpleValue;
   
   //constructor
   public VerySimple()
   {
      simpleValue = 10;
   }
   
   //methods with -or- without parameters
   
   //properties
   
   //enums

}
```

A `class` is synonymous with `type`

Constructors have the look of a method but return nothing. They are used as **initializers**
A constructor **MUST** have the same name as the class it is created in.
